## About

A2Z Recyclers:
The more we recycle, the less garbage winds up in the landfills and incineration plants. By reusing aluminium, paper, glass, plastics, and other materials, we can save production and energy costs, and reduce the negative impacts that the extraction and processing of virgin materials have on the environment.
Recycling reduces the need for extracting (mining, quarrying and logging), refining and processing raw materials all of which create substantial air and water pollution. As recycling saves the energy it also reduces greenhouse gas emissions, which helps to tackle climate change.
Mission statement
At A2Z recyclers we understand the connection between a healthy planet and good recycling habits. We aim to make our earth green and inculcate recycling as a habit, not a practice.
Vision
To promote recycling habits in every household and business organisation.

## Projects undertaken

• Collaborated with an organization Ecogenie
This one is a Producers Responsibility Organisation that helps you yield maximum benefits from your trash, and specialises in recycling all kinds of packaging waste. The pan-India service also makes recycled apparel, blankets and toys, majorly produced from their sustainably recycled PET bottles.

• Co- founded an organization Good Food
Founded in 2015, this organisation helps food chains and restaurants manage their waste at the source. They collect reject waste from the premises, provide data-driven feedback modules on proper segregation to staff, and ensure that the highest possible amount of waste is reused or recycled. Through their mobile app, which also has a tracking monitor, customers can understand the quality and quantity of their waste on user-friendly graphs. Till date, Good Food has diverted over 9,000 tonnes of waste from landfills.

• Partnered with Green Plastic
Green Plastic connects waste-pickers to global markets, and helps brands switch to high-quality recycled plastic for packaging their goods. Their mobile app provides urban waste-pickers with access to fair market prices, and they are also slowly foraying into coastal communities to address the root cause of ocean plastic.

Recycling household waste
Your home is where you treasure the most valuable things in life. And there's nothing more putting-off than having your home cluttered with unused items that take away its charm.
However, you can always adopt a recycling habit to spruce up your living space.
Here are 4 easy recycling techniques to practice and give a refreshing touch to your home:  
• Plastic Water Bottles - Plastic water bottles are the worst enemy one can have indoors. People often dispose of plastic bottles irresponsibly after use and thus harm the environment. With a little use of creativity, plastic bottles can come to good use. For instance, you can cut off the bottom halves of the plastic bottles and plant seedlings in them. These nifty plant-holders are easy to craft and will be a great addition to your garden space.
• Aluminum Foil - Aluminum foil has various uses in our daily lives and can be handy at times. However, their disadvantage, like that of unused plastic items, is that they are non-biodegradable. But fret not, there are ways to upcycle and reuse aluminum foil, rather than disposing it off after one use - you can place the foil behind plants in the shade and use the foil as a reflector.
• Build an Eco-brick - Thousands of plastic bottles end up lying in landfills every year as they can only be recycled a finite number of times. So rather than just throwing them away, you can use them to make nifty eco-bricks. These bricks can be used for making modular furniture, as a decorative item for your garden and a paperweight to name a few.

• Reuse Your Home Delivered Newspaper - If you're one of those people who gets their newspaper delivered regularly then this recycling technique is the best fit for you. Instead of stocking up on your old newspapers, you can use them as packing paper to wrap up your fragile items or gifts. You can also use a newspaper as a cleaning aid by mixing water and a splash of white vinegar to clean your window stains, effortlessly.
Recycling Business / organization waste
• Reuse Old Office Supplies By Introducing An Upcycle Station
Whenever employees have old office furniture, phones, computers, staplers, etc. they are organized and placed in a designated shelving area known as the “Upcycle Station”. When an employee is in need of a “new” office supply, it is protocol to check the Upcycle Station before re-ordering any new items.
• Reduce The Amount Of Waste Coming Into Your Facility
When it comes to the 3Rs of recycling and actively increasing your waste diversion rate, the best thing your facility can do is REDUCE. This means focusing on your supply stream and what you bring into your facility. Promote your program to your vendors and work to bring in only items that are recyclable or compostable. If you can control what’s coming into your facility, you have a much better chance at diverting more waste from landfill because the waste your facility is producing is already recyclable, reusable or compostable.
• Ditch Take Out Coffee Cups
We can’t ask employees to give up their morning coffees, but just think about how many of those cups get tossed in the office waste bins daily. Instead, opt to provide them with reusable coffee mugs and water bottles. This small change can drastically reduce the amount of coffee cups and plastic bottles filling up your waste and recycling streams.
• Office behavioural changes
Changing the attitudes of office workers towards the creation of waste in the first place can have a major impact on waste production. Eliminating waste by working more carefully, making fewer errors, or simply considering whether or not to print a document can cut down paper use considerably. Switching off lights and equipment when leaving the office, making sure that taps are turned off and cutting down on heating and air conditioning can all reduce waste of scarce and expensive resources. Introducing a positive attitude towards reuse and recycling of materials can have similar benefits.
